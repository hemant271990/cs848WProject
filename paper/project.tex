% ****************** AUTHORS **************************************

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.


% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.
%
% 1st. author
% 2nd. author
% 3rd. author
\author{
\alignauthor Hemant Saxena \\
	\affaddr{University of Waterloo}\\
	\email{h2saxena@uwaterloo.ca}
}

% There's nothing stopping you putting the seventh, eighth, etc.
% author on the opening page (as the 'third row') but we ask,
% for aesthetic reasons that you place these 'additional authors'
% in the \additional authors block, viz.
%\additionalauthors{Additional authors: John Smith (The Th{\o}rv\"{a}ld Group, {\texttt{jsmith@affiliation.org}}), Julius P.~Kumquat
%(The \raggedright{Kumquat} Consortium, {\small \texttt{jpkumquat@consortium.net}}), and Ahmet Sacan (Drexel University, {\small \texttt{ahmetdevel@gmail.com}})}

% is the number that will appear on the first page PLUS the
% number that will appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\begin{abstract}
Integrity constraint violations in databases have become a major problem, primarily caused as a side affect of data integration or Web data extraction from varied sources.
Resolving these violations is challenging for various reasons, primarily because of exponential number of possible repairs for a given violation.
Some of the previous data cleaning approaches have tried to generate a single most optimal repair, or a set of possible repairs, but they focused on the violations caused by certain specific constraints like, functional dependencies, conditional functional dependencies, and matching dependencies.
In this paper we extend the idea of generating multiple repairs for a general set of constraints defined in form of denial constraints.
When we are generating multiple repairs for a violation, it is important to provide the repairs which have minimal number of changes. 
Given that the problem of generating minimal repairs for denial constraint violations is MaxSNP-Hard, we propose a constrained randomized algorithm that is capable of generating sample repairs from a defined space of possible repairs.
We have used the idea of repair expressions, used in holistic data cleaning of denial constraint violations.
Our algorithm ensures two things: first, all the repairs for a single repair expression are minimal in some sense and second, it generates all possible repair expressions such that, their repairs avoid any new violations.
